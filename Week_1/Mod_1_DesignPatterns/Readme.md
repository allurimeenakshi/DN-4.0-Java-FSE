# Module 1 - Design Patterns and Principles

## üìò Overview
This module introduces learners to essential software design principles and patterns that are fundamental to developing robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.

You will explore:
- The SOLID principles: a core set of guidelines for object-oriented software design.
- Common design patterns: categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.

By combining theory with hands-on exercises, this module helps you understand how to write cleaner, modular, and extensible code.
